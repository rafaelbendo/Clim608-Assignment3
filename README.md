Assignment #3 is due November 12, 2024 by midnight. See below for instructions.

1. Go to the site here: https://psl.noaa.gov/data/climateindices/list/ and pick a climate index. You can use pandas or numpy to read in the data. Remember to read the documentation for it!

2. Using your data, build a composite map for the relevant "phases" or conditions (positive, negative, neutral) for your index.

3. Plot the differences against neutral conditions. If your index doesn't have a neutral condition, make a comparison between positive and negative phases in your index.

4. Use an appropriate statistical test for your data and mark the regions in your differences map where the differences are statistically significant using stippling, hatching, or transparency.
